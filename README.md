# README for Ruby on Rails "book_collection" application

This app can be launched via heroku at https://assignment3rubyonrails.herokuapp.com/

Or, if you want to copy the files and run it on a server locally:
$ git clone <this_URL>    ~> clone this repository to a directory on your local machine
$ cd <YOUR_PATH>          ~> navigate to the location of that directory
$ rails s                 ~> run the rails project on a local server
Then rails will generate some output to let you know your project is running

This app runs on a local host at https://localhost:3000
